# 4. Conclusion 
### Through this project, I feel like I'm still lacking a lot. Some functions are still unfinished and haven't been completed in time.The advantage of the project is that working alone makes it easy to manage and control functions, gui and ideas, with fewer errors and conflicting ideas.The obvious disadvantage is the lack of human resources to complete this project in about 2 weeks and the project is limited to only 1 person so it is difficult to expand with new ideas.Regarding improvements, I think I will try to perfect the remaining functions of the project and expand more features such as logging in with gmail, facebook; Order management, revenue management,...
